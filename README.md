# Power System Optimization Model

This repository contains a Python-based optimization model for capacity expansion planning and economic dispatch of a power system with conventional generation, renewable energy (wind & solar) and battery storage. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses linear programming to determine optimal generation dispatch and investment decisions under multiple technical and policy constraints.

📌 Features

* Capacity expansion for Wind, Solar, Battery storage.
* Fixed capacity for Coal, Gas, Nuclear.
* Hourly economic dispatch
* Renewable penetration constraints
* Storage charging/discharging with efficiencies
* Outputs written to Excel
