Power System Optimization Model

This repository contains a Python-based optimization model for capacity expansion planning and economic dispatch of a power system with conventional generation, renewable energy (wind & solar), battery storage, and market transactions. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses linear programming to determine optimal generation dispatch and investment decisions under multiple technical and policy constraints.
